# ðŸ›  Installation and Setup

## Overview

Northwestern's [Quest High Performance Computing Cluster](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/user-services/quest/) is the only platform currently supported for installation and setup. By using a central containerized version on Quest it is ensured that all users are working in the same environment and compatibility issues will be much less common. We are providing Desktop instructions as a courtesy and do not recommend local installation at this time.&#x20;
